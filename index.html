    <h3>Marcello Gil Lessa Cardoso</h3>

    <p>Hi, my name is <strong>Marcello</strong>, and I'm going
    to start to describe somethings about myself, as an exercice
for coding on <em>Ubuntu</em> with a VM Machine from <strong>Oracle</strong>,
in the <em>VS Code</em> from <strong>Microsoft</strong>. Also I'm trying to
understand better the <em>Git</em> functions on <strong>GitHub</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Of course, using that exercice to improve my english, as well.
    </p>

    <!-- Added a comment here just to make a another version, and learn to
    do that, also to commit and push to GitHub-->
